# Overview


Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another. On a basic level, it performs simple substitution of words in one language for words in another, but that alone usually cannot produce a good translation of a text because recognition of whole phrases and their closest counterparts in the target language is needed. Solving this problem with corpus statistical, and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies.

A deep learning based approach to MT, Neural Machine Translation has made rapid progress in recent years. **Translator** is a Machine Translation Autoencoder built using Seq2Seq Recurrent Nets (LSTM, GRU) with Attention in PyTorch.
